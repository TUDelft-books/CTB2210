# Lesson Monday September 21st

During today's lesson you'll work on a complex exercise on the topic of statical determinacy. Please ask your questions regarding the [homework](homework4.1) as well!

## Exercise 1

Given the following structure:

Structure
```

For which we'll determine the degree of external static indeterminacy.

`````{exercise}
:label: so_2_1
:nonumber: true

Split the structure into the largest possible rigid, pin-connected parts and draw the free body diagram of the pin-connected parts.
